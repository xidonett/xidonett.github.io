          <p>Passionate Software Engineer originally from Odessa, Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦<br><br> Started my journey at age of 12, was interested in Computer Science, UNIX-based systems. Was eager to learn the game design, but when started to develop my first video games, realised, that I want to try something more engaged into the business needs. Urgently learned the <em>web design, HTML, CSS, JS</em> and decided to take my first project via social media. Will be straight forward: the first experience wasn't so good, but in age of 15 I received the very first salary from my beloved hobby :) It was the WordPress page for a Moscow therapist</p>
